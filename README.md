The main issue I ran into was compiiling the jar file.
The solution was to type in d: and then my account name to get back to my documents
I then had to put the jar file into the folder I was working in
After I had put it in I then ran the compile line in my terminal provided by my teacher
However it took me around 30 minutes to figure out I had to change "Main.java" to my "(Your class name).java
